    "OOPs is a way of organizing code that uses objects and classes to represent real-world entities and their behavior.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** An object could represent a person with properties like a name, age, and address, and behaviors such as walking, talking, breathing, and running. Alternatively, it could represent an email with properties such as a recipient list, subject, and body, as well as behaviors like adding attachments and sending.  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions** are called `methods` in OOP world. **Characteristics** are `attributes` (properties). Technically **attributes** are `variables` or `values` related to the state of the object whereas *methods* are `functions` which affect the attributes of the object.\n",

    " #### Advantages of OOPs:  \n",
    "- Provides a clear structure to programs\n",
    "- Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug\n",
    "- Helps keep your code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)\n",
    "- Allows you to build reusable applications with less code\n",
    "#### Disadvantages of OOPs:  \n",
    "- Difficulty in testing and debugging: \n",
    "- Designing a program using OOP principles takes more time than procedural approaches\n",
    "- Not Ideal for all problems(like small logics or scripts)\n",
    "- Complex relationships, like A single change in a parent class, can have cascading effects on all derived classes\n"

    "* **Purpose:** Static methods are like regular functions that happen to be defined within a class. They have no access to instance-specific data (`self`) or class-specific data (`cls`). Their primary usage is for creating helper or utility functions that logically belong to the class but don't require any specific instance or class context.\n",

    "### **1. Inheritance**  \n",
    "**Inheritance** is a fundamental concept in Object-Oriented Programming that enables a new class, known as the child class (or subclass), to acquire properties `(attributes)` and behaviors `(methods)` from an existing class, referred to as the parent class (or superclass). This relationship is often described as an \"is-a\" relationship\n",

    " Inheritance is vital for creating organized, efficient, and extensible codebases:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Code Reusability:** One of the most significant benefits is the ability to reuse code. Common attributes and methods can be defined once in a parent class, and all child classes can automatically inherit and utilize them without needing to rewrite the same code. This reduces redundancy and streamlines development.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Extensibility:** Inheritance makes a system highly extensible. New functionalities or specialized behaviors can be easily added to child classes without altering the existing parent class code, allowing for flexible program expansion.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modeling \"Is-A\" Relationships:** It provides a clear and intuitive way to model hierarchical relationships between real-world entities. For instance, a SportsCar is a Car, and a Car is a Vehicle, creating a logical structure in the code.   \n",

    "### **3. Encapslation**       \n",
    "The definition of encapsulation is \"the action of enclosing something in or as if in a capsule\". Removing access to parts of your code and making things private is exactly what Encapsulation is all about (often times, people refer to it as data hiding). Encapsulation means that each object in your code should control its own state. The state is the current \"snapshot\" of your object. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Why is it Important?**  \n",
    "Encapsulation offers several critical advantages in software development:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Integrity:** By controlling access to data through methods and encapsulation, it ensures that data is modified only in valid and predictable ways. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Security:** It acts as a protective barrier, safeguarding sensitive information by limiting direct external access. This enhances the overall security posture of the application.   \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Controlled Access:** Encapsulation provides flexibility in how data can be interacted with. Developers can design methods that allow variables to be read-only (getters), write-only (setters with validation logic), or both, giving precise control over data manipulation.   \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **How to Achieve it in Python**\n",
    "  \n",
    "**Public Members:**\n",
    " By default, all attributes and methods defined within a Python class are considered public. This means they can be freely accessed from any part of the code, whether inside or outside the class. Like `self.value`would be a public attribute.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Protected Members:** A single underscore prefix `(_)` before a member's name denotes it as protected. This is a widely accepted convention signaling that the member is primarily intended for use within the class itself and its subclasses.\n",
    "\n",
    " **Private Members:** A double underscore prefix `(__)` before a member's name indicates that it is private. When an attribute or method is prefixed with `__`, Python automatically performs **\"name mangling**.\" This process alters the name of the attribute by adding an underscore and the class name to the beginning (e.g., __value in a Car class becomes _Car__value).

    "### **4. Abstraction**   \n",
    "**Abstraction** is one of the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It allows you to **hide internal implementation details** and show only the **relevant functionality** to the user. Think of it as a way to focus on *what an object does* rather than *how it does it.*\n",

    "####  Real-Life Analogy of Abstraction\n",
    "When you drive a car, you use the **steering wheel, accelerator, and brakes**—you don’t need to know how the engine, fuel pump, or sensors work internally. That’s abstraction in action: hiding complexity and exposing only what's essential.\n",

    "\n",
    "Function wrappers, commonly referred to as **decorators**, are a powerful feature in Python that allow developers to modify or enhance the behavior of a function or method without altering its original code.

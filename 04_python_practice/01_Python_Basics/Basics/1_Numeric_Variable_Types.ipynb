    "Welcome to the first Python notebook you will go through during the bootcamp. We hope you have all had a look at the materials we shared with you before the course. In the following notebooks we will go through all the topics you have already seen in the preparation material to refresh your knowledge. For those of you who have worked with Python before and are comfortable with programming, it might be easy. For some, it may only be the second time they've heard of most of the topics and some of the exercises might already be challenging. That's fine! No one becomes a true Pythonista overnight. To become good at programming, you need one thing above all: **practice**! And that's why today we will start by reviewing the basics. For some topics, we will dive deeper and expand your knowledge from the preparation notebooks. \n",

Although `my_first_variable` would be in snake_case it is not a good variable name.
